# Spatial Partitioning Implementation - Octree for Frustum Culling

## üéØ Objective

Optimize frustum culling performance in the Photos3D viewer by implementing spatial partitioning using an Octree data structure. This reduces the number of visibility checks from O(n) to O(log n) for large photo collections.

## üì¶ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Octree Composable** (`src/composables/useOctree.js`)

A complete Octree implementation with the following features:

#### Classes:

- **`OctreeNode`**: Individual node that recursively subdivides 3D space into 8 octants
  - Configurable max objects per node (default: 8)
  - Configurable max depth levels (default: 5)
  - Automatic subdivision when object count exceeds threshold
- **`Octree`**: Main structure that manages the tree
  - Automatic bounds calculation from objects
  - Efficient insertion and spatial queries
  - Debug information and statistics

#### Key Methods:

- **`buildOctree(objects)`**: Constructs the tree from an array of photo objects
- **`queryFrustum(frustum)`**: Returns only objects potentially visible in the camera frustum
- **`queryRadius(point, radius)`**: Finds objects within a sphere (useful for proximity queries)
- **`getAllBounds()`**: Returns all bounding boxes for debug visualization
- **`getStats()`**: Returns tree statistics (total objects, depth, etc.)

### 2. **Photos3D Integration**

Modified `src/components/Photos3D.vue` to use the Octree:

#### Changes Made:

1. **Import and Initialize**:

   ```javascript
   import { useOctree } from "@/composables/useOctree.js";

   const {
     buildOctree,
     queryFrustum,
     queryRadius,
     getStats: getOctreeStats,
     getAllBounds,
     clear: clearOctree,
   } = useOctree(8, 5); // maxObjects=8, maxLevels=5
   ```

2. **Optimized `updateVisiblePhotos()` Function**:

   - Before: Checked all filtered photos linearly (O(n))
   - After: Uses octree query to get candidates first (O(log n))
   - Falls back to linear search for small collections (<100 photos)
   - Still performs final precise sphere-frustum intersection test

3. **Automatic Octree Rebuild Triggers**:
   - When animations complete (`updateTransitionPositions`)
   - When radial scaling changes (`onInflateFactorChange`)
   - When new photos are registered (`registerNewPhotos`)
   - When photo positions update (`updatePhotosPositions`)

### 3. **Debug Visualization** (Dev Mode)

Optional feature to visualize the octree structure:

#### Features:

- Toggle in Display Options panel (only visible when `DEBUG_3D = true`)
- Draws wireframe boxes for all octree nodes
- Green semi-transparent lines showing spatial subdivision
- Helps tune maxObjects and maxLevels parameters
- Automatically updates when octree rebuilds

#### Usage:

1. Set `DEBUG_3D = true` in Photos3D.vue
2. Open Display Options panel
3. Toggle "Octree Debug (Dev)"

## üöÄ Performance Impact

### Before (Linear Search):

- **Complexity**: O(n) - checks every photo against frustum
- For 1000 photos: ~1000 frustum intersection tests per frame

### After (Octree Spatial Partitioning):

- **Complexity**: O(log n) - only checks relevant octree nodes
- For 1000 photos: ~50-100 candidate tests (depending on camera position)
- **~10-20x reduction** in frustum checks for large scenes

### Best Performance Gains:

- Large photo collections (>500 photos)
- When camera view captures small portion of scene
- Dense clusters with varying distances

## üîß Configuration

### Octree Parameters:

```javascript
useOctree(maxObjects, maxLevels);
```

- **`maxObjects`**: Objects per node before subdivision (default: 8)
  - Lower = deeper tree, more granular culling
  - Higher = shallower tree, less overhead
- **`maxLevels`**: Maximum tree depth (default: 5)
  - Prevents infinite subdivision
  - Level 5 = up to 32,768 leaf nodes (8^5)

### Tuning Tips:

1. **For very large collections (>5000)**: Increase maxLevels to 6
2. **For dense clusters**: Decrease maxObjects to 4-6
3. **For sparse distributions**: Increase maxObjects to 12-16
4. Use debug visualization to see node distribution

## üìä Monitoring

The implementation logs useful information:

```javascript
// When octree rebuilds:
"üå≥ Octree rebuilt for frustum culling: { totalObjects: 847, maxLevels: 5, ... }";

// During culling:
"üîç Octree culling: 847 total -> 124 candidates -> 89 visible";
```

## üß™ Testing

To verify the implementation:

1. **Load a large photo collection** (>500 photos)
2. **Enable debug mode** (set `DEBUG_3D = true`)
3. **Check console logs** for octree statistics
4. **Enable octree visualization** to see spatial structure
5. **Navigate the scene** - should feel smoother with large collections

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:

1. **Dynamic parameter adjustment** based on scene size
2. **Parallel octree queries** using Web Workers
3. **Persistent octree** for better chunk switching performance
4. **Ray casting** for object picking using octree
5. **Collision detection** using spatial queries

## üìù Notes

- Octree rebuilds are **lazy**: only when `octreeNeedsRebuild` flag is set
- For collections <100 photos, octree is bypassed (overhead not worth it)
- Octree uses `markRaw()` to avoid Vue reactivity overhead
- All THREE.js objects in octree queries are reused to prevent garbage collection

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

1. ‚úÖ Created Octree spatial partitioning composable
2. ‚úÖ Integrated Octree into Photos3D component
3. ‚úÖ Added automatic octree rebuild on position changes
4. ‚úÖ Added debug visualization for octree (optional)
